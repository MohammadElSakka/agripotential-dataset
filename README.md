# Agricultural Potential Dataset

Agricultural potential refers to the capacity of a specific area to produce crops. This potential is influenced by environmental factors such as soil quality and climate. This repository proposes a remote sensing multimodal multisource and multitemporal dataset built for supervised AI. This repository contains the code needed to construct the dataset from raw files. However, the ready-to-use dataset is made available using the following command:
```
python3 main.py dataset
```

Tutorials are provided to guide you at using the dataset structure in ```notebooks/```

# Input features
Input features include data collected in 2019 that consists of:
- 11 multispectral Sentinel-2 images 

# Output labels
The potentiality of 3 types of plantations:
- Market gardening (fr: mara√Æchages)
- Viticulture
- Field crops (fr: grandes cultures)

The potential has 5 levels ranging from very limited to very high.


# Creating Python virtual environment

## On Linux 

```
python3 -m venv agri_venv
source agri_venv/bin/activate
pip install jupyter
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=agri_venv --display-name "Python (agri_venv)"
cat requirements.txt | xargs -1 pip install 
```
